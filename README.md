## Disaster Prediction and Damage Assessment Model
This repository presents a robust model designed to predict natural disasters and assess their impact using satellite imagery. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the MobileNet architecture, this project aims to enhance disaster response and recovery efforts.

## Overview:
The model processes and analyzes satellite images to detect patterns indicative of various natural disasters, such as floods. By effectively classifying these images, the model not only predicts the occurrence of disasters but also estimates the extent of damage caused.

## Key Features:
Accurate Disaster Prediction: Utilizing advanced image processing techniques, the model identifies and classifies different types of disasters, providing timely alerts for better preparedness.

## Damage Assessment
 The model quantifies the damage inflicted by disasters, offering insights that can guide response strategies and resource allocation.

## MobileNet Architecture
Designed for efficiency, MobileNetâ€™s lightweight nature allows for rapid processing of large datasets, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Potential Applications
This tool can be used by governmental agencies, NGOs, and disaster response teams to improve situational awareness and decision-making in emergency scenarios.

## Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow/Keras
Satellite Imagery Data
This project aims to contribute to more effective disaster management through innovative machine learning approaches and to ultimately save lives and resources during critical situations.
